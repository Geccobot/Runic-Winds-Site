## Custom CSS that couldn't be replaced with Bootstrap utilities
- `:root --brand` and `.brand-accent`: custom brand color for the navbar/logo text.
- `.shadow-soft`: a deeper shadow than Bootstrap’s default shadow provide.


## Most challenging component
-Modal + Toast interaction: coordinating the modal close and triggering a toast smoothly required some JavaScript.

## Easiest component
-Accordion: Bootstrap provides a straightforward pattern and it worked immediately once IDs were wired.

## How the framework improved my code
- Reduced the amount of custom CSS needed by using classes.
- Built responsive layouts faster using the grid and breakpoint classes.

## Framework features I liked / disliked
- Liked: grid system, utility classes, prebuilt components.
- Disliked: class-heavy HTML can get cumbersome. 
- Adding custom colors is a headache.
